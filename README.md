<summary>Notice for anyone who is interested in the origin/creation of this repository.</summary>
<br><sup>This collection is collected and checked by myself, not a rip/reupload of any other collection, a few have problems:</sup><br><br>
<sup>1. VX-Undergrounds builder archive is mostly aggregated from 'BlackHatRussia', a site run by 'Adrikadi'.</sup><br>
<sup>BlackHatRussia's owner 'Adrikadi' backdoors many tools with a crypto clipper, gaining profit illictly from it.</sup><br>
<sup>A few examples of issues, are the LuminosityLink builder being bound to a cryptominer while I provide a clean version.</sup><br>
  
<br>
<sup>2. Other GitHub collections have either unclean or purposely infected collections, including binding everything with a miner/backdoor.</sup><br>
<sup>For example, if anything here's infected it's cleaned/documented, such examples are 'WizWorm' with a backdoor in the stub.</sup><br>
<sup>Cleaned samples include 'MrTeeDol' which had a backdoor embedded in the server itself, which has been removed before uploading.</sup><br>
<br>
<sup>3. The purpose of this repo is to provide researchers/malware analysts clean builders to create IOCs/Yara rules.</sup><br>
<sup>I disclaim all liability for any issues arising from the use of these constructor/builder samples for any purposes other than research.</sup></br>
